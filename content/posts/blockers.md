# Things That Stopped My Journey to Catholicism

A few things that I do not agree with, or I do not _see_ or I do not _understand_ about Catholicism.

Catholicism has opened my eyes to many things including the _newness_ and the _incorrectness_ of some critical Protestant doctrines and theology. What you believe ultimately affects how you view God, which affects the way you live and conduct your life.

1. The _Perceived_ Ultra-focus on Mary
1. That Mary was sinless, and the Immaculate Conception
1. The Merit System
    - The focus & emphasis on a judicial process
    - I do these things, I get this reprieve or earn favor with God.
1. The understanding and consequence of "original sin."
1. The sacrament of confession, as taught by the Catholic Church.
    - I believe in the sacrament of confession, but not as I understand the Catholic teaching.
1. Purgatory:
    - The common understanding
    - Still vague and unanswered questions from both sides.

## The Perceived Ultra Focus on Mary

Many Protestants and non-Catholics often levy the charge that Catholics worship Mary and place her higher than even Christ. I was certainly one of them. This perception comes from interacting with "cultural" Catholics or reading the many posts about Mary on social media. This is not; however, the result you get when you dig into Catholic doctrine as found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Like many cultural Baptists in the south, many Catholics do not know what the Church teaches about many things. Like many (perhaps the majority) of professing Christians, they are Bible ignorant. Their understanding of the Bible and what their denomination actually teaches is woefully lacking and distorted. "Well my priest says...", "My pastor said..", "I just believe that..." - but who among us is serious enough to search out the scriptures? To search out the teachings, the dogmas, the doctrines of our faith?

I have often heard Catholics say this or that, when a cursory reading of the CCC will show them to be in error. One of those things is the hyper focus of Mary.

There are several things concerning Mary that Protestants have rejected due to "Sola Scriptura" and being "Rome-a-phobic." We will delve into some of the major problems "Sola Scriptura" engenders later. 

### The perpetual virginity of Mary. 

This has been believed and accepted by Christians since the beginning. This has been taught and defended by Origen (185 - 253AD), Athanasius (360AD), St Jerome (342 - 420AD). While the The Protoevangelium of James is not authoritative, it does give us insight as to what first and second century Christians believed. 

### An intercessor in prayer

All the saints are engaged in prayer and intercession before God Almighty. Mary holds a predominate place as the mother of God. For the ancient Jewish culture, the mother of the king was considered the queen, not the wife; for kings usually had many wives. Solomon brought a special chair for his mother to sit with him at court. To say that Mary is Queen of Heaven is not a stretch.

### Warping, Perversions and Misunderstandings

- Prayers **TO** Mary

    While it is both right and we are encouraged to ask for intercessory prayer, we must not pray to Mary in the way we would petition God the Father or His Son, Jesus Christ. Asking the saints to pray **for** us right, just as if you asked your father or a friend to pray for you. But to attribute to Mary, or any other saint, the same level of worship that belongs only to God is wrong.

- Giving Mary a higher place than is warranted

    Many cultural Catholics are "obsessed" with Mary. They make her the focus of their lives. She dominates the many ignorant posts on social media. Their dedication and adoration of her far outweighs their dedication and focus of Christ. Granted, there are some new converts who have a new knowledge, and therefore and new zeal, for the truth of Mary and the saints that Protestants have buried; to them we extend grace and patience. But most are cradle Catholics whose knowledge base was formed by Facebook posts, coffee cup inscriptions and pithy rebuttals to non-Catholics. 

- They petition her because she will ask her Son, and a good Son always listens to his mother, right?

    I've heard this many times. Even among educated and knowledgeable Catholics. This is a weird and perverse twist, and it honestly gets under my skin. This attitude would make Christ "beholding" to his mother. Christ was given ultimate authority and possess all wisdom, knowledge and power. He is not obligated to respond to the requests of any. While the intersessions of Mary and the saints may carry more weight, asking them to pray should not be viewed as a magic rabbits foot to get what you want. 

    Asking Mary to go to Christ with your request, just so it can be granted would be very dangerous. Read 1 Kings chapter 2. Adonijah asks King Solomon's mother, Bathsheba, to go to her son with specific request. Read what happened. Not the fairy tale ending one would expect.
