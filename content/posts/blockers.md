# Things That Stopped My Journey to Catholicism

A few things that I do not agree with, or I do not _see_ or I do not _understand_ about Catholicism.

Catholicism has opened my eyes to many things including the _newness_ and the _incorrectness_ of some critical Protestant doctrines and theology. What you believe ultimately affects how you view God, which affects the way you live and conduct your life.

1. The _Perceived_ Ultra-focus on Mary
1. That Mary was sinless, and the Immaculate Conception
1. The Merit System
    - The focus & emphasis on a judicial process
    - I do these things, I get this reprieve or earn favor with God.
1. The understanding and consequence of "original sin."
1. The sacrament of confession, as taught by the Catholic Church.
    - I believe in the sacrament of confession, but not as I understand the Catholic teaching.
1. Purgatory:
    - The common understanding
    - Still vague and unanswered questions from both sides.

## The Perceived Ultra Focus on Mary

Many Protestants and non-Catholics often levy the charge that Catholics worship Mary and place her higher than even Christ. I was certainly one of them. This perception comes from interacting with "cultural" Catholics or reading the many posts about Mary on social media. This is not; however, the result you get when you dig into Catholic doctrine as found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Like many cultural Baptists in the south, many Catholics do not know what the Church teaches about many things. Like many (perhaps the majority) of professing Christians, they are Bible ignorant. Their understanding of the Bible and what their denomination actually teaches is woefully lacking and distorted. "Well my priest says...", "My pastor said..", "I just believe that..." - but who among us is serious enough to search out the scriptures? To search out the teachings, the dogmas, the doctrines of our faith?

I have often heard Catholics say this or that, when a cursory reading of the CCC will show them to be in error. One of those things is the hyper focus of Mary.

There are several things concerning Mary that Protestants have rejected due to "Sola Scriptura" and being "Rome-a-phobic." We will delve into some of the major problems "Sola Scriptura" engenders later. 

### The perpetual virginity of Mary. 

This has been believed and accepted by Christians since the beginning. This has been taught and defended by Origen (185 - 253AD), Athanasius (360AD), St Jerome (342 - 420AD). While the The Protoevangelium of James is not authoritative, it does give us insight as to what first and second century Christians believed. 

### An intercessor in prayer

All the saints are engaged in prayer and intercession before God Almighty. Mary holds a predominate place as the mother of God. For the ancient Jewish culture, the mother of the king was considered the queen, not the wife; for kings usually had many wives. Solomon brought a special chair for his mother to sit with him at court. To say that Mary is Queen of Heaven is not a stretch.

### Warping, Perversions and Misunderstandings

- prayers TO Mary
- giving Mary a higher place than is warranted
- go to her because she will go to her Son and he will listen to her
  - This diminishes Christ's preeminence
  - Makes Christ "beholding" to his mother
  - be careful what you ask
