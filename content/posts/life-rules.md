## Sucess

1. Find a quiet place to pray and read. Use that as a sanctified place for your time with God.
1. Bring coffee. This may be optional, but for me there is a type of comfort to have a good cup of coffee while I read God's word.
1. Read a Proverb each day. A good guide is to read the chapter that corresponds to that day. For example, on the first day of the month, read chapter one. On the 17^th^ day, read chapter seventeen.
