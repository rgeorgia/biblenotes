## Week 10 Living in the Light of the Gospel

## Study Book Questions

1. Overarching Exhortation (12:1-2)

- What is a **living** sacrifice?

    - Sacrifice is not always associated with sin or forgiveness. Almost all are *gifts* we give to God. It is a participation in in showing our love for God.
    - The Jews under the law brought sacrifices of their first fruits and flocks. This was an act of faith and trust. They toiled to provide for their family daily. By giving to God, you took a chance that you may not have enough food to feed your family. But by faith you brought what was precious to you to the Creator of all things.
    - Jews and Pagans offered dead animals to their god(s). We offer ourselves, alive


## Raw Notes

### 12:1-2

- As Christ offered himself as a sacrifice, well pleasing to God, we too must present ourselves, holy, without spot or blemish as a living sacrifice. 
- **NOTE WORTHY**: Christ offered his body as a sacrifice. The Church is the body of Christ; therefore, we too should be continually offering ourselves as well.
- While Christ offered himself once, for all; the Church (his body) offers a continual sacrifice to God.

- The sacrifice as living stands in contrast to the dead and lifeless sacrifices of animals and produce as practiced by Jews and Pagans
- Just as the OT sacrifice was to be an animal without spot or blemish, we too offer our bodies to God, holy, without spot, without blemish.

#### **Transform** not **conform**

- We are not to be conformed to this world (age)
- The world applies constant pressure to our mind and heart, inviting, seducing and even demanding that we conform.
- Not conforming goes far beyond outward actions. It encompasses attitudes and desires. Paul will begin to list areas where we are to be non-conformists.
- Our tendency is to justify why we "need" to behave a certain way.
- We justify things that seem to go "too far"
- We try to fit things into our paradigm. 
- Transformed - **metamorpho**
    - Same word used for the transfiguration of Christ
    - Like a caterpillar to a butterfly
- We **continually** renew our minds.
- What's in your mind? (Now this would be a good commercial)
- Without renewing we fall into adopting the *world's* views, our faith becomes brittle and easily broken.
- If we are conformed to this world, our "sacrifice" is blemished. (Mal 1:7-8)

### 12:3-8

- Don't think of yourself more highly then you ought.
    - This is totally contrary to what "world" pushes.
    - This is an area we need to transform
- Sober judgment - according to the measure of faith. This is why we are to consider the weaker brother.
- **One** body with many members
    - Gifts are for the edification of the body **NOT** the individual possessing the gift.
    - This is contrary to worldly thinking which pushes the "what's in it for me?" mentality or "I need to be appreciated, needed and respected."
    - Be and individual! Says the world
    - Remember Simon in the book of Acts.
- Being high minded causes one to place himself above others.
- Any sense of superiority is unreasonable

#### Measure of faith

- Not saving faith, but rather is is the ability "the individual capacity to receive spiritual gifts, which capacity God gives for different Christians in differing measures."

**NOTE** Often we tend to segment our lives into actions that are spiritual and actions that are secular. We have a "spiritual" ministry, but a "secular" job. This is wrong and misguided thinking. 

### Let Love Be Genuine

- Love without hypocrisy
- HATE what is EVIL
- How does one determine what is evil?
- How do we prevent worldly definitions from influencing our standard?
- How do we prevent our culture from leaking into our judgment of good and evil?
- What is "genuine" love?
- HATE, ABHOR, REJECT
- CLING, HOLD FAST
- In order to genuinely love without hypocrisy, to hate and abhor evil, one must purge the mind, wash the thoughts with **total submission** to God's word.
- Bible reading, study, memorizing and internalizing cannot be an after thought. It is not something you "fit in" to your schedule.
- It **must** take prescience

#### Show Honor

- Removes pride and thinking highly of yourself.
