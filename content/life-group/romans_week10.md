## Week 10 Living in the Light of the Gospel

## Study Book Questions

1. Overarching Exhortation (12:1-2)

- What is a **living** sacrifice?

    - Sacrifice is not always associated with sin or forgiveness. Almost all are *gifts* we give to God. It is a participation in in showing our love for God.
    - The Jews under the law brought sacrifices of their first fruits and flocks. This was an act of faith and trust. They toiled to provide for their family daily. By giving to God, you took a chance that you may not have enough food to feed your family. But by faith you brought what was precious to you to the Creator of all things.
    - Jews and Pagans offered dead animals to their god(s). We offer ourselves, alive


## Raw Notes

- As Christ offered himself as a sacrifice, well pleasing to God, we too must present ourselves, holy, without spot or blemish as a living sacrifice. 
- **NOTE WORTHY**: Christ offered his body as a sacrifice. The Church is the body of Christ; therefore, we too should be continually offering ourselves as well.
- While Christ offered himself once, for all; the Church (his body) offers a continual sacrifice to God.

- The sacrifice as living stands in contrast to the dead and lifeless sacrifices of animals and produce as practiced by Jews and Pagans
- Just as the OT sacrifice was to be an animal without spot or blemish, we too offer our bodies to God, holy, without spot, without blemish.

### **Transform** not **conform**

- We are not to be conformed to this world (age)
- The world applies constant pressure to our mind and heart, inviting, seducing and even demanding that we conform.
- Not conforming goes far beyond outward actions. It encompasses attitudes and desires. Paul will begin to list areas where we are to be non-conformists.
- Our tendency is to justify why we "need" to behave a certain way.
- We justify things that seem to go "too far"
- We try to fit things into our paradigm. 
- Transformed - **metamorpho**
    - Same word used for the transfiguration of Christ
    - Like a caterpillar to a butterfly
- We **continually** renew our minds.
- What's in your mind? (Now this would be a good commercial)
- Without renewing we fall into adopting the *world's* views, our faith becomes brittle and easily broken.
- If we are conformed to this world, our "sacrifice" is blemished. (Mal 1:7-8)
