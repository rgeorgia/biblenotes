## Week 10 Living in the Light of the Gospel

## Study Book Questions

1. Overarching Exhortation (12:1-2)

- What is a **living** sacrifice?

    - Sacrifice is not always associated with sin or forgiveness. Almost all are *gifts* we give to God. It is a participation in in showing our love for God.
    - The Jews under the law brought sacrifices of their first fruits and flocks. This was an act of faith and trust. They toiled to provide for their family daily. By giving to God, you took a chance that you may not have enough food to feed your family. But by faith you brought what was precious to you to the Creator of all things.
    - Jews and Pagans offered dead animals to their god(s). We offer ourselves, alive


## Raw Notes

### 12:1-2

- As Christ offered himself as a sacrifice, well pleasing to God, we too must present ourselves, holy, without spot or blemish as a living sacrifice. 
- **NOTE WORTHY**: 
    - Christ offered his body as a sacrifice. The Church is the body of Christ; therefore, we too should be continually offering ourselves as well.
- While Christ offered himself once, for all; the Church (his body) offers a continual sacrifice to God.
>
- The sacrifice as living stands in contrast to the dead and lifeless sacrifices of animals and produce as practiced by Jews and Pagans
- Just as the OT sacrifice was to be an animal without spot or blemish, we too offer our bodies to God, holy, without spot, without blemish.

#### **Transform** not **conform**

- We are not to be conformed to this world (age)
- The world applies constant pressure to our mind and heart, inviting, seducing and even demanding that we conform.
- Not conforming goes far beyond outward actions. It encompasses attitudes and desires. Paul will begin to list areas where we are to be non-conformists.
- Our tendency is to justify why we "need" to behave a certain way.
- We justify things that seem to go "too far"
- We try to fit things into our paradigm. 
- Transformed - **metamorpho**
    - Same word used for the transfiguration of Christ
    - Like a caterpillar to a butterfly
- We **continually** renew our minds.
- What's in your mind? (Now this would be a good commercial)
- Without renewing we fall into adopting the *world's* views, our faith becomes brittle and easily broken.
- If we are conformed to this world, our "sacrifice" is blemished. (Malachi 1:7-8)

>7 “You have shown contempt by offering defiled sacrifices on my altar.
>“Then you ask, ‘How have we defiled the sacrifices?’
>“You defile them by saying the altar of the Lord deserves no respect. 8 When you give blind animals as sacrifices, isn't that wrong? And isn't it wrong to offer animals that are crippled and diseased? Try giving gifts like that to your governor, and see how pleased he is!” says the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.

### 12:3-8

#### High Minded

- Don't think of yourself more highly then you ought.
    - This is totally contrary to what "world" pushes.
    - Being high minded causes one to place himself above others.
    - Any sense of superiority is unreasonable
    - This is an area we need to transform

>O Lord and Master of my life!
>
>Take from me the spirit of sloth,
>idle curiosity, lust of power, and idle talk.
>
>But give rather the spirit of chastity,
>humility, patience, and love to Thy servant.
>
>Yes, Lord and King! Grant me to see my own faults
>and not to condemn my brother,
>for blessed are You forever and ever. Amen
>
> Lenten Prayer of St. Ephrem the Syrian 

#### Measure of faith

- Not saving faith, but rather is is the ability "the individual capacity to receive spiritual gifts, which capacity God gives for different Christians in differing measures."

**NOTE** Often we tend to segment our lives into actions that are spiritual and actions that are secular. We have a "spiritual" ministry, but a "secular" job. This is wrong and misguided thinking. 

#### Let Love Be Genuine

- Love without hypocrisy
- HATE what is EVIL
- How does one determine what is evil?
- How do we prevent worldly definitions from influencing our standard?
- How do we prevent our culture from leaking into our judgment of good and evil?
- What is "genuine" love?
- HATE, ABHOR, REJECT
- CLING, HOLD FAST
- In order to genuinely love without hypocrisy, to hate and abhor evil, one must purge the mind, wash the thoughts with **total submission** to God's word.
- Bible reading, study, memorizing and internalizing cannot be an after thought. It is not something you "fit in" to your schedule.
- It **must** take prescience

#### Show Honor

- Removes pride and thinking highly of yourself.

#### Bless, not curse

Romans 12:14
>14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.

- This is totally opposite of how _the world_ thinks. 
- "By meeting hostility with love, we show that we are _other worldly_.

- Sober judgment - according to the measure of faith. This is why we are to consider the weaker brother.
- **One** body with many members
    - Gifts are for the edification of the body **NOT** the individual possessing the gift.
    - This is contrary to worldly thinking which pushes the "what's in it for me?" mentality or "I need to be appreciated, needed and respected."
    - Be and individual! Says the world
    - Remember Simon in the book of Acts.

Romans 12:15-21

>15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep. 16 Live in harmony with one another; do not be arrogant, but associate with the lowly; do not claim to be wiser than you are. 
>
>17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all. 18 If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. 19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord.” 20 Instead, “if your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them something to drink, for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads.” 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good

- "Instead of quickly lashing back when insulted, we should take forethought for what is right before all men. Rather than instantly responding, we must fire think 'How will the response commend the Gospel to the world?'" 

- reveling and drunkenness
- illicit sex and licentiousness
    - illicit = not permitted or unlawful
    - licentious = lacking legal or moral restraint, especially sexual restraint
- quarreling and jealousy

#### Are you committed, serious, in the game?
- Put on the Lord and make no provision for the flesh
- We need a "scorched earth" mentality when it comes to resisting and battling sin
- This is what Hezekiah models in 2 Chronicles 32:4
>4 Many people gathered and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land; they said, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find abundant water?” 

#### Vengeance, Death Wish
- Again... 180 degrees than what the _world_ teaches and expects.
- Popular "Revenge" movies

#### Government Appointed by God

- Notice this comes right after talking about being subject to government.
- God's tool
    > who says to Cyrus, “My shepherd, he will fulfill all my pleasure” and says to Jerusalem, “She will be rebuilt,” and of the temple, “Its foundation will be laid.” (Isa 44:28)
    >
    >The Lord says this to Cyrus, his anointed, whose right hand I have grasped to subdue nations before him and disarm kings, to open doors before him, and even city gates will not be shut: (Isa 45:1)

- Render properly
    >Then he said to them, “Give, then, to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”(Matt 22:21)

Romans 13:11

>11 Besides this, you know what time it is, how it is already the moment for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we became believers; (NRSVue)
>11 Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed. (ESV)

**Question**
- If salvation comes with "when you belief" then what "salvation" is Paul talking about? A future event? The redemption of our bodies?
