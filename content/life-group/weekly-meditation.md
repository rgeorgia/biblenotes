## Who is Jesus?

- The bread of life (John 6:35, 48)
- The bread that came down from heaven (John 6:41) 
  - Manna
- The *living* bread (John 6:51)
- The light of the world (John 8:12)
- He is the image of the invisible God (Col 1:15)

## What did he accomplish?

- He died on the cross. That's something he **did**, but what did that accomplish?

### Colossians

- He has **rescued** us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves (Col 1:13)
- He is also the head of the body, the church; (Col 1:18)
- He is the beginning,
- The firstborn from the dead
- He reconciled everything to himself (Col 1:20)
- Making peace through the blood of his cross (Col 1:20)
- But now he has reconciled you by his physical body (Col 1:22)
- He made you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses. 
- He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross.
- He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; 
- He triumphed over demons, principalities, and the Devil.

## What does he expect?

- you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith and are not shifted away from the hope of the gospel that you heard (Col 1:23)
