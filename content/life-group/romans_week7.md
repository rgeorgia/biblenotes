## Week 7 Life In the Spirit (Romans 8:1-39)

> 1. There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, [a] **who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.**  (NKJV)

> 1. There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (ESV)

[a] The earliest manuscripts of Alexandrian and Western texts have no additional words for verse 1. "Later scribes added the words 'who do not walk according to the flesh.' Even later 'but walk according to the Spirit' where added. It is *assumed* that the latter was added to "insulate Paul's gospel from charges that it was characterized to much by grace."

St. John Chrysostom (347 - 407), in Homily VIII on Romans, comments 

> Wherefore Paul gives thanks, because Christ, without any rigorousness about these things, no only demanded no account of the moderate amount, but even made us able to have a greater race set before us. And therefore he says, "I than my God through Jesus Christ." And letting the salvation which all agreed about pass, he goes from the point he had already made good, to another further point, in with he states that it was not our former sins only that we were freed from, but we were also made invincible for the future. For "there is," he says, "now no condemnation to the which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh."

> Then as the fact that many fall into sin even after baptism... he consequently hastened to meet it, and says not merely "to them that are in Christ Jesus," but adds, "who walk not after the flesh;" so showing that all afterward comes of our listlessness. 
(Homilies on Romans. Fig Press; 1842)


### No condemnation.

> Not only is he forgiven his sins, but he is liberated from their power and inner compulsion. Under the law he was a miserable prisoner of war and cried out "Who will rescue me?" (Farley, The epistle to the Romans: A gospel for all 2005 p 95)

It is by the power of God's Spirit we are made free from the law of sin and death.

The "law of sin and death" is **not** a reference to the Law of Moses, which Paul calls, spiritual.
