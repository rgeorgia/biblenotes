## Week 7 Life In the Spirit (Romans 8:1-39)

## Study Book Questions

1. Life in the Spirit (8:1-17)

- **First** we need to define condemnation. What is condemnation?

- From the previous 7 chapters, what leads Paul to say that the believer is under no condemnation?
	- Now we are no longer under the law, but under grace. We are IN CHRIST through baptism, therefore, there is **no** condemnation. 

- What role does _union_ with Christ play in this verse?
	- Through union with Christ we are partakers of his death, burial and resurrection

- Why the phrase "in the likeness of sinful flesh?"
	- What does "in the likeness of sinful flesh" mean?
	- This is the reason for his incarnation.
	- "For that which He has not assumed He has not healed" (St Gregory of Nazianzus, 329 - 390)
>If anyone has put his trust in Him as a Man without a human mind, he is really bereft of mind, and quite unworthy of salvation. For that which He has not assumed He has not healed; but that which is united to His Godhead is also saved. If only half Adam fell, then that which Christ assumes and saves may be half also; but if the whole of his nature fell, it must be united to the whole nature of Him that was begotten, and so be saved as a whole.


- Sin "lives" in the realm of the flesh, therefore, to defeat sin, Christ must enter into that arena. 
- **Likeness** - not similar but exactly.

- How does one set their mind on the "things of the Spirit?" (8:5-8)
	- Memorize scripture
	- Train your mind to think on things above
	- Actively _mind_ spiritual things
- Is sanctification God's work our ours? (cf 1Cor 15:10; Phil 2:12-13; Col 1:29)
	- It's both. It is synergistic. We work **with** Christ.
	- He provides the power and the direction.
	- "3 Can two people walk together without agreeing on the direction?" Amos 3:3
	- "My yoke is easy..."
- What does it mean to be an heir? What does it mean to be a joint-heir with Christ?
	- We inherit all that our father has in his house.
	- We are joint-heirs, **future** glory and reigning in the age to come.
	- **IF** we suffer with him
2. The Assurance of Hope (8:18-39)
- What revelation is uncovered about sin? (8:12-22)
	- It not only ruined mankind, but affects ALL of creation.
	- No man sins in private. It affects all those around you.
	- Bitterness infects and defiles others (Heb 12:15)
	- "the cedar has fallen" (Zech 11:2)
- Misinterpreting Romans 8:28
	- The same way we stop halfway through 8:17, we stop part way through 8:28
	- "And we know all things work together for good <**STOP**>
	- This and Phil 4:13 are ripped out of context.

### Rough notes, thoughts and green things in general

Romans 8 seems to be divided into three sections:

1. Life in the Spirit (1 - 17)
2. Future Glory (18 - 30)
3. Confidence by being in Christ (31 - 39)

### Variants with verse 1

> 1. There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, [a] **who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.**  (NKJV)

> 1. There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. (ESV)

[a] The earliest manuscripts of Alexandrian and Western texts have no additional words for verse 1. "Later scribes added the words 'who do not walk according to the flesh.' Even later 'but walk according to the Spirit' where added. It is *assumed* that the latter was added to "insulate Paul's gospel from charges that it was characterized to much by grace."

St. John Chrysostom (347 - 407), in Homily VIII on Romans, comments 

> Wherefore Paul gives thanks, because Christ, without any rigorousness about these things, no only demanded no account of the moderate amount, but even made us able to have a greater race set before us. And therefore he says, "I than my God through Jesus Christ." And letting the salvation which all agreed about pass, he goes from the point he had already made good, to another further point, in with he states that it was not our former sins only that we were freed from, but we were also made invincible for the future. For "there is," he says, "now no condemnation to the which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh."

> Then as the fact that many fall into sin even after baptism... he consequently hastened to meet it, and says not merely "to them that are in Christ Jesus," but adds, "who walk not after the flesh;" so showing that all afterward comes of our listlessness. 
(Homilies on Romans. Fig Press; 1842)


### No condemnation

**Condemnation**

- What is condemnation?
- "Neither do I condemn you."
- "If our heart condemns us... Christ is greater than..."
- He condemns sin in the flesh (7:3)

John 3:16-21(NKJV)

>16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to **condemn** the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.
>
>18 “He who believes in Him is not **condemned**; but he who does not believe is **condemned** already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the **condemnation**, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. 21 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.”

Christian Standard Bible

>16 For God loved the world in this way:[a] He gave[b] his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Anyone who believes in him is not condemned, but anyone who does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. 19 This is the judgment: The light has come into the world, and people loved darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone who does evil hates the light and avoids it,[c] so that his deeds may not be exposed. 21 But anyone who lives by[d] the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be shown to be accomplished by God.”

John 8:10
Christian Standard Bible

>10 When Jesus stood up, he said to her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”
>11 “No one, Lord,” she answered. “Neither do I condemn you,” said Jesus. “Go, and from now on do not sin anymore.”

- In Christ
  - by baptism
  - baptized into Christ

> Not only is he forgiven his sins, but he is liberated from their power and inner compulsion. Under the law he was a miserable prisoner of war and cried out "Who will rescue me?" (Farley, The epistle to the Romans: A gospel for all 2005 p 95)

It is by the power of God's Spirit we are made free from the law of sin and death.

The "law of sin and death" is **not** a reference to the Law of Moses, which Paul calls, spiritual.

- I see that with my mind or inner-self, I serve the law of God
- But my members the law of sin
- There is a war!
  - Our comfort driven, consumer style Christianity pushes back at the thought that life in Christ is a continual and constant struggle against sin and temptation.
  - We are told to put on the armor of God, for what? Show? Fashion? To be trendy or admired?
  - No, we **fight**, we **struggle**, we violently fight against the forces that surround us.
  - Thank God, there are more with us than with them.
- Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death?
  - This is why Christ came, to deliver us. To rescue us from sin, death and demons.
- Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our **Lord**
- Note that he refers to Christ Jesus as **Lord**, that is, the **master** we are to **serve**. He makes us free from this sin. He strengthens us to be able to resist sin and serve righteousness.
- Mind and flesh

------

- law of the Spirit of life in Christ
- law of sin and death

- The requirements of the law are fulfilled in us through Christ
  - WHO WALK **NOT** ACCORDING TO THE FLESH, BUT ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT
- Walk not and walk
- Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the flesh
- We are to serve Christ with the mind
- "Set your mind (desire) on things above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God."
- Set your mind can be thought as your "mind set". Or the things you "tend to". We "mind" the garden by spending time and effort keeping it clean.
 
>1 So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
>2 **Set your minds** on the things that are above, not on the things that are on earth, 
>3 for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 
>4 When Christ who is your life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.
>5 **Put to death**, therefore, whatever in you is earthly: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry). 
>6 On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient.
>
>Col 3:1-6

### Romans 8:31-39

>33 Who can bring an accusation against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies. 
>34 Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, but even more, has been raised; he also is at the right hand of God and intercedes for us. 


Isaiah 50:8-10 (CSB)
Christian Standard Bible

>8 The one who vindicates me is near;
>who will contend with me?
>Let us confront each other.
>Who has a case against me?
>Let him come near me!
>
>9 In truth, the Lord God will help me;
>who will condemn me?
>Indeed, all of them will wear out like a garment;
>a moth will devour them.
