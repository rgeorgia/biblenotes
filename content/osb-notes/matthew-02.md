2:1 Herod: See note on Lk 1:5. The wise men, or magi, who come from the East(most likely Persia), were the scholars of their time. In the OT, Balaam (Nm 23; 24) was one of their predecessors, a Gentile who anticipated the Messiah. These foreigners prefigure the Church, in which membership is determined by faith and not by ethnic lineage.

2:2 The star proclaims the extraordinary birth of Christ. To ancient pagans, a star signified a god, a deified king (Nm 24:17). Christ being born under this star fulfills the prophecy in Ps 109:3 and shows all of creation participating in the Incarnation. (See also Pss 18:2; 148:3.)

2:4 Herod had to summon the Jewish leaders because he knew little about the Jewish Messiah and he feared losing his throne to this newborn King. The chief priests were the political and religious leaders of the Jews, and the scribes were high cabinet officers. They knew where the Messiah was to be born, but in spite of all the signs being in place, they had no idea that He had come (see 16:3).

2:11 Into the house: Whereas the Jewish shepherds worshiped the Savior in the cave on the day He was born (Lk 2:8-20), the Gentile magi came to worship Him some time later. By then, Joseph and Mary had found a house in which to dwell. This indicates that Christ first came to the Jews and then afterward was worshiped by the Gentiles. The significance of the Magi's gifts is revealed in a hymn sung at Compline of the Nativity: “Gold is for the King of ages. Frankincense is for the God of all. Myrrh is offered to the Immortal One, who shall be three days dead.”

2:14 Egypt is where Israel once took refuge; as Joseph of the OT once saved God's people by bringing them to Egypt (Gn 39-47), now Christ's stepfather Joseph finds safety for the Savior in Egypt. It is probable that the gifts of the magi paid for this journey.

2:15 Out of Egypt I called my Son refers first to Israel being brought out of captivity (Hos 11:1). In the OT, “son” can refer to the whole nation of Israel. Here Jesus fulfills this calling as the true Son of God by coming out of Egypt.

2:16 The cruelty of Herod was prefigured by Pharaoh, who, in an attempt to destroy the power of Israel, commanded the death of all the newborn Jewish boys (Ex 1:16, 22).

2:17-18 Jeremiah recorded the people of Jerusalem being led away to exile (Jer 38:15). On their way to captivity, they passed Ramah, which was near Bethlehem, where Jacob's wife Rachel lay buried. In his prophecy, Jeremiah saw Rachel, even from the grave, moved with compassion for the fate that had befallen her descendants. Here Rachel is again weeping for her children, showing that the saints in heaven have awareness and compassion for those yet on earth. These slaughtered children are regarded as saints and martyrs in the Church and are known as the Holy Innocents. Just as Rachel was told that her children would return from exile in Babylon (Jer 38:16, 17), so Jesus will return from His exile in Egypt.

2:19 According to historical records, Herodthe Great died in 4 BC. The date of Christ's birth on which our current AD (Anno Domini, Latin for “year of the Lord”) calendar is based is off by four years.

2:22 Augustus Caesar banished Archelausfor his cruelty in AD 6. This cruelty was revealed as a warning to Joseph; hence the detour to Nazareth (v. 23). This town was in Galilee and was governed by another son of Herod the Great, whose name was Herod Antipas (see Lk 3:1).

2:23 The prophecy here cannot be exactly identified. It has been taken as a reference to the rod (Heb. neser) in Is 11:1, and to the Nazirite (Heb. Nazir) of Jdg 13:5. Matthew may also have been alluding to passages in which the Messiah was despised, since Nazareth did not have a good reputation (Jn 1:46).
