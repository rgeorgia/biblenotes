## Chapter 1

**1:1** **Jesus** means "O Lord, save," referring to His role as Savior (v.21). **Christ** means "Anointed One," the Messiah, the One who is filled with the Holy Spirit (see John 1:33). Through the Son alone became Man, God the Father and the Holy Spirit work in Jesus Christ to save us.
Jesus became Man as a Jew, from the lineage of **Abraham**, the father of all Jews, and of **David**, Israel's greatest king and prototype of the royal Messiah. This **genealogy** reveals that the Son of God so identifies with the human condition that He takes it all on Himself and become part of it. Christ's ancestry includes both righteous and wicked people, faithful kings and murderers, Jews and Gentiles, kings and peasant.

**1:2** While Luke's genealogy runs from Jesus back to Adam (Luke 3:23-38), Matthew's list descends from **Abraham**, with whom God established the Old Covenant of circumcision, to Jesus, the author of the New Covenant. God promised to bless all the tribes of the earth in Abraham (Genesis 12:3; 28:14); this promise is fulfilled in Abraham's greatest Son, Jesus Christ.

**1:3** Jewish genealogical lists normally included only men. The mention of women (**Tamar**, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) is unusual. Each one was either a Gentile or a sinner. The inclusion of these women declares God's graciousness and prefigures the calling of Gentiles into the Church. It also underscores the role of women in God's plan of salvation and anticipates the special place of the Virgin Mary in that plan.

**1:6** Through anointing by Samuel, David was made king. Through his psalms, David was revealed as a great prophet. Thus David foreshadows both the royal and prophetic nature of Jesus Christ (Psalms 109). As an adulterer and a murderer, David functions as a type of all repentant sinners.

**1:16** **Joseph** can be named as Jesus' immediate predecessor since OT marriage laws confer hereditary rights on adopted as well as biological sons. The church fathers teach, Mary also was descended from David; **of whom** is feminine in Greek, referring only to Mary. Thus, Jesus is show to be born of Mary, and not begotten of Joseph. (See also notes on Luke 3:23-38)

**1:17** Christ's ancestors are arranged in three groups of fourteen generations. Fourteen is the numerical equivalent of the consonants in the name **David**, underlining Jesus' descent from David. This also shows the division of the leadership of the Jews, being under judges until David, under kings until **Babylon** and under priests until Christ.

**1:19** The righteousness of **Joseph** consisted of a mercy that transcends the Law (Hos 6:6). Joseph showed this mercy by his unwillingness to expose Mary's supposed sin, even though he was obliged by the Law to do so. **Her husband**: The Bible calls engaged couples husband and wife before their marriage (Rachel was called the wife of Jacob before marriage by virtue of their engagement in Genesis 29:21; see also Deuteronomy 22:23,24). Thus, Joseph is called the husband of Mary, and Mary is called his wife (vv. 20, 24). In the Church, Joseph is remembered as the Betrothed, point out Mary's ever-virginity. (See also note on Ester 2:7)

**1:20** An **angel** (or "messenger") **of the Lord** dispels Joseph's false reasoning by announcing the utterly unreasonable: the pregnancy of the Virgin is by the Holy Spirit. Being born of a virgin proves Christ's divinity; only a revelation by God could serve as adequate evidence of this miracle.

**1:22** Matthew repeatedly uses the formula **that it might be fulfilled which was spoken** (see 2:15, 23; 4:14; 8:17; 12:17; 13:35; 21:4; 26:56; 27:35). This underscores the intervention of God throughout history, demonstrates the continuity between the Old and New Covenants, and indicates the beginning of the new creation.

**1:23** The conception of Jesus fulfills Isaiah 7:14, where we are told that a **virgin** would conceive and **bear a Son**.He who is conceived in Mary is not a new Person coming into existence but the eternal Son of God now using her womb as His throne. Both the virginal conception by means of the Holy Spirit and the name **Immanuel, God with us** declare Christ's divinity.

**1:25** The use of the word **till** does not imply that Joseph had marital relations with Mary after the Savior's birth. In the Bible, this word (sometimes translated "to") is often used to express a situation that actually continues after the event mentioned (see 28:20; Genesis 8:7; Deuteronomy 34:6; 2Kings 6:23). The witness of the entire Church throughout history is that Mary remained a virgin for life. **Firstborn**: See note on Luke 2:7.
