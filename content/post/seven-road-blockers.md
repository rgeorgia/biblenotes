# Seven Things That Stopped My Journey to Catholicism.

Some things that I do not agree with, or I do not _see_ or I do not understand about Catholicism.

Catholicism has opened my eyes to many things including the _newness_ and the _incorrectness_ of many Protestant doctrines and theology.

1. The sinlessness of Mary
2. The immaculate conception
3. The perceived ultra-focus on Mary
4. The merit system
    - The focus & emphasis on a judicial process
    - I do these things, I get this repreave or earn favor with God.
5. The understanding and consequence of "original sin."
6. I believe in the sacrament of confession, but not as I see it in the Catholic Church.
7. Purgatory:
    - The common understanding
    - Still vague and unanswered questions from both sides.
