## I am Ronverbs

I am a struggling Christian, loyal husband, father and Papa. 

I **LOVE** books, books and more books. My wife and I think going to a bookstore is a cool idea for a date. I love the Bible and have read it through from cover to cover more than 40 times. I love books on Christianity, doctrine and Church history. Right now I am reading a lot of books about Orthodoxy. Capital "O" and small "o." One book that impacted me greatly is "The Desert Fathers: Sayings of the Early Christian Monks" by Benedicta Ward.


I love books about Python, Rust and programming in general. I am do like [NetBSD](http://netbsd.org/). I am working on setting up a NetBSD desktop. 

This site will be, and is, a collection of thoughts and musings I have written down during my morning devotional reading. 

Enjoy.
