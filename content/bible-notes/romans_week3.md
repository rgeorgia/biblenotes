## Week 3: God's Righteousness in His Wrath Against Sin

## Raw and Unorganized Notes

The power of the Gospel is set in contrast against the human state **without** the gospel.
Paul's assessment of paganism is influenced by his Jewishness. Compare [Romans 1:18-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A18-32&version=ESV) with [Wisdom 13:1-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Wisdom%2013%3A1-9&version=NRSVCE); [14:22-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Wisdom%2014%3A22-27&version=NRSVCE)

### The Foolishness of Nature Worship

"Paul in not talking here about a personal knowledge of God, which requires faith, but a factual knowledge of God's existence and certain of his predicates." (_Romans: An Orthodox Commentary_, Patrick Reardon)

Idolatry darkens the heart. First the thoughts are turned away, then idolatry is expressed in the body as sexual immorality. (Ibid)

Paul is speaking of rejection by a society, not every individual within it. When society fails to acknowledge God as God, turning to idolatry, sexual perverseness rules the day.

This is a description of a pagan society, without the gospel.

"God's judgment falls, then, not only on the malefactors themselves, but on the society that condones, excuses, permits or approves such malefaction." (Ibid)

## The Study Guide

### Reflection and Discussion

1. **The Unrighteousness of the Gentiles (1:18-32)**

Compare Romans 1:20 with Psalm 19:1. How do "the things that have been made" give clear evidence of God's "eternal power and divine nature"?

Paul uses phrases like "God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts" (1:24), "God gave them up to dishonorable passions" (1:26) and "God gave them up to a debased mind" (1:28). What implications do such proclamations have for the idea of "free will"?

If sinners "suppress the truth" (1:18), how can Paul say that the truth is "clearly perceived" (1:20)?

Paul is revealing that even the irreligious are aware of a holy standard. What are some ways in which even those who deny God demonstrate a tacit awareness of moral absolutes?

2. **The Unrighteousness of the Jews (2:1-3:8)**


3. **The Unrighteousness of All People (3:9-20)**
