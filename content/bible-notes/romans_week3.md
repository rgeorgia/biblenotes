## Week 3: God's Righteousness in His Wrath Against Sin

## The Study Guide

### Reflection and Discussion

1. **The Unrighteousness of the Gentiles (1:18-32)**

How does creation give evidence of God's power?

- By observing and contemplating the world around us, we understand that there is a designer, a "being" that transcends what our eyes see naturally. Just as one knows the artist is greater than the painted portrait, we know instinctively that the creator is greater than the creation.

- This is what man tends to reject, worshiping the creation which is seen, more than the creator which is not seen.

What implications do such proclamations have for the idea of "free will"?

- Free will is reinforced by revealing the fact that though they knew God, they chose to reject Him, they chose to **not** acknowledge Him as God (worship), therefore God gave them over to what they want, the pursuit of sinful pleasure. Worshiping their will over His.
- This is reminiscent of Pharaoh. Pharaoh hardened his own heart and God, in His foreknowledge hardened Pharaoh's heart as well. 
- **NOTE:** According to Dr. De Young, the word "hardened" is described as one being presented with a situation and deliberately choosing the lowest or worst option. To sink to a lower place.

How can Paul say that the truth is "clearly perceived" (1:20)?

- One can only suppress what they know exists. How can someone suppress something they do not know about?

Natural demonstration of moral absolutes.

- When you see people react angrily to any violation of human rights. If there are no absolute (or general) morals, who cares how others are treated, as long as I'm not hurt.
- When a professing atheist throws himself on a grenade to save the life of others and is considered a hero. If life was meaningless, that person would be considered a fool instead of a hero.
- The list goes on.

2. **The Unrighteousness of the Jews (2:1-3:8)**

Why do we condemn ourselves when we judge others?

- Because we are guilty of the same thing or we are guilty of something similar.
- We condemn the person who takes merchandise from a store as a thief, yet we justify ourselves when we glibly waste 2 hours of company time discussing last night's football game. Oh! That's **not** stealing at all.

How is it not partiality?

- I don't understand this question. The passage is obvious. 
  - It doesn't matter who you are, Jew or Gentile, if you do wrong, you will receive afflict, distress and wrath.
  - If you do what is right, you receive glory, honor, and immortality. 
  - **There is no difference**
- A better, elephant in the room question is this, Romans 2:6 states, "He will repay each one according to **his works**. How is that salvation by grace and faith alone without works?
- Note the phrases, "does evil", "does what is good", "not the hears but the doers" - I'm not sure of the answer completely... Yet.
- I know many will try to wiggle their way out by saying, "it doesn't really mean we are judged according to our works, it's talking about rewards. Or something like that; however, that's only side-stepping the question. 
- JUST SAY'N. :)



3. **The Unrighteousness of All People (3:9-20)**

## Raw and Unorganized Notes

The power of the Gospel is set in contrast against the human state **without** the gospel.
Paul's assessment of paganism is influenced by his Jewishness. Compare [Romans 1:18-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A18-32&version=ESV) with [Wisdom 13:1-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Wisdom%2013%3A1-9&version=NRSVCE); [14:22-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Wisdom%2014%3A22-27&version=NRSVCE)

### The Foolishness of Nature Worship

"Paul in not talking here about a personal knowledge of God, which requires faith, but a factual knowledge of God's existence and certain of his predicates." <sup>1</sup>

Idolatry darkens the heart. First the thoughts are turned away, then idolatry is expressed in the body as sexual immorality.  <sup>1</sup>

Paul is speaking of rejection by a society, not every individual within it. When society fails to acknowledge God as God, turning to idolatry, sexual perverseness rules the day. <sup>1</sup>

This is a description of a pagan society, without the gospel.

"God's judgment falls, then, not only on the malefactors themselves, but on the society that condones, excuses, permits or approves such malefaction." <sup>1</sup>

God's love and universal righteousness find their counterbalance in His universal wrath...
The parallel is set by stressing that both his righteousness and his wrath is revealed.

Sin is not simply misbehaving, it is a refusal to know Him, to break off the relationship with God.

> That is, all men -- all Gentiles, all the nations -- know the truth about God, but they **hold back** or suppress that knowledge, turning from that truth to a life of unrighteousness and callous hardheartedness. The deliberately try to forget what they know, distracting themselves with a life of sin <sup>1</sup>

### Legalism vs Spiritual

Romans 2:29. "The name **Jew** comes from "Judah," which means "the Lord be praised." A **true** Jew is one who seeks **praise ... Not from men but from God**.The end goal for legalism is to have praise from men; the goal of the spiritual person is to please God. <sup>2</sup>

### Comments on Faith

>Faith is an act of the soul. At its deepest level faith is an act—and then a habit—through which the soul is joined to Christ.
>
>Faith is not something simply added-on to the soul. It remodels the soul.
>
>Faith is a relationship of transforming grace. It is a not a merely juridical or declarative reality. It is a psychological reality, because it is an act and habit by which the soul permits itself to be seized and grasped by Christ.
>
>Faith, then, is my foundational relationship to the person of Christ, and in giving him my trust and obedience I trust and obey God. As my faith grows by serving as the basis of my decisions and choices in life, my soul is altered by faith <sup>3</sup>
