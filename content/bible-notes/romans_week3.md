## Week 3: God's Righteousness in His Wrath Against Sin

## Raw and Unorganized Notes

The power of the Gospel is set in contrast against the human state **without** the gospel.
Paul's assessment of paganism is influenced by his Jewishness. Compare Romans 1: 

The Foolishness of Nature Worship
### Wisdom 13 

> 1 For all people who were ignorant of God were foolish by nature;
and they were unable from the good things that are seen to know the one who exists,
nor did they recognize the artisan while paying heed to his works;
>
> 2 but they supposed that either fire or wind or swift air,
or the circle of the stars, or turbulent water,
or the luminaries of heaven were the gods that rule the world.
>
> 3 If through delight in the beauty of these things people assumed them to be gods,
let them know how much better than these is their Lord,
for the author of beauty created them.
>
> 4 And if people were amazed at their power and working,
let them perceive from them
how much more powerful is the one who formed them.
>
> 5 For from the greatness and beauty of created things
comes a corresponding perception of their Creator.
>
> 6 Yet these people are little to be blamed,
for perhaps they go astray
while seeking God and desiring to find him.
>
> 7 For while they live among his works, they keep searching,
and they trust in what they see, because the things that are seen are beautiful.
>
> 8 Yet again, not even they are to be excused;
>
> 9 for if they had the power to know so much
that they could investigate the world,
how did they fail to find sooner the Lord of these things?

"Paul in not talking here about a personal knowledge of God, which requires faith, but a factual knowledge of God's existence and certain of his predicates." (_Romans: A Commentary_, Patrick Reardon)

Idolatry darkens the heart. First the thoughts are turned away, then idolatry is expressed in the body as sexual immorality. (Ibid)

Paul is speaking of rejection by a society, not every individual within it. When society fails to acknowledge God as God, turning to idolatry, sexual perverseness rules the day.

This is a description of a pagan society, without the gospel.
