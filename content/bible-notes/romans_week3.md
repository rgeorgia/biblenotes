## Week 3: God's Righteousness in His Wrath Against Sin

## Raw and Unorganized Notes

The power of the Gospel is set in contrast against the human state **without** the gospel.
Paul's assessment of paganism is influenced by his Jewishness. Compare [Romans 1:18-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A18-32&version=ESV) with [Wisdom 13:1-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Wisdom%2013%3A1-9&version=NRSVCE); [14:22-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Wisdom%2014%3A22-27&version=NRSVCE)

### The Foolishness of Nature Worship

"Paul in not talking here about a personal knowledge of God, which requires faith, but a factual knowledge of God's existence and certain of his predicates." (_Romans: An Orthodox Commentary_, Patrick Reardon)

Idolatry darkens the heart. First the thoughts are turned away, then idolatry is expressed in the body as sexual immorality. (Ibid)

Paul is speaking of rejection by a society, not every individual within it. When society fails to acknowledge God as God, turning to idolatry, sexual perverseness rules the day.

This is a description of a pagan society, without the gospel.

"God's judgment falls, then, not only on the malefactors themselves, but on the society that condones, excuses, permits or approves such malefaction." (Ibid)
