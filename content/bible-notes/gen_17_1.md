**Summary**: The key to a successful Christian life

> When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him, saying, â€œI am God Almighty. **Live in my presence and be blameless**. (Gen 17:1)

Here is the key to a Christian life, _live in my presence and be blameless_. How many sins would be averted, temptations repelled and thoughts turned aright if we would truly live in his presence? Live, knowing that He is there and can see all things, even the intents of your heart. 

### Be blameless
Not be sinless, but blameless. Let us not be the cause for a weaker brother to stumble, or be fuel to the charge that Christians are hypocrites. Let us not be as the priests who walked by on the other side.
