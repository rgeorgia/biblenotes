# Jonah

## Chapter 1

**1:1,2** Jonah's calling is set apart from that of the other prophets because he is commanded to preach not to his own people, the Jews, but to the Ninevites. The Book of Jonah points to Christ's Great Commission (Matt 28:19,20) in four ways: (1) **Arise and go to Nineveh** parallels Christ's words, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations." (2) Jonah's deliverance from the belly of the whale foreshadows the baptism of which Christ speaks in the same passage: "baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." (3) Jonah's preaching to Nineveh foreshadows the apostles' preaching in the nations in obedience to Christ's command: "teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you." (4) God's protection of Jonah is echoed in Christ's words, "and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."

**1:2** **Nineveh** was the capital of the Assyrian Empire. See Tob 14:4, 8; 3Mc 6:8.

## Chapter 2


## Chapter 3

**3:2** **According to the message I previously spoke to you**: A reminder to Jonah that the message and the mission had not changed.

**3:5-9** In an amazing response to Jonah's preaching, the Ninevites show us the true meaning of repentance in the following ways: (1) By the ancient practice of fasting, which implied a total fast. (2) By wearing **sackcloth** and **ashes**. Sackcloth was a rough, uncomfotable cloth made of goat and camel hair, used for making brain bags. It was worn as a sign of mourning (see Gen 37:34; Est 4:3; 1Mc 2:14; Matt 11:21). Putting ashes on one's head also symbolized mourning or repentance (see 2Kg 13:19; Is 58:5; Jer 6:26). (3) By prayer. (4) By changing their behavior. True repentance is not just feeling sorry, but involves both heart and actions.

**3:6** **The king** acted after the people. This was a spontaneous, popular movement, not imposed by the crown but inspired by the Holy Spirit.

## Chapter 4

**4:1-7** Once again, Jonah's weakness controls him. Here Jonah's excessive nationalism is expressed in his disappointment at God's mercy. He knew God's character, and anticipated what would happen; yet , like the proud brother in the story of the Prodigal Son (Lk 15:11-32), he hoped to see the Ninevites destroyed. "After all," he might have said, "why would God want to save foreigners?" The **gourd** that is damaged by the **worm** is an icon of this attitude, which is personified in the unbelievers who allow pride and jealousy at the salvation of others to enter their hearts. Many like these will put Christ to death, thus bringing about their own destruction.

**4:4** The Lord's question to Jonah is rhetorical and a rebuke. The tone of the Greek implies that, in fact, Jonah does *not* have the to feel the way he does.

**4:11** The people of the nations live in spiritual darkness until the light of the gospel is brought to them by God's messengers: the apostles, preachers, and all the faithful, who bear equal responsibility to "make disciples of all nations" (Mt 28:19). **And many livestock:** The Lord's comapssion extends to all He has created, including the animals.
