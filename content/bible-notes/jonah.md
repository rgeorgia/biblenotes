# Jonah

## CHAPTER ONE

> 1:2  “Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it because their evil has come up before me.”

### Arise and go
- All obedience requires effort and action
- Often we are to disturb our position of ease and comfort in order to arise and perform the task He has given us.
- Be a witness of Christ to a hostile world, to your enemies, to the ones you are at odds with.
- This is what our God asks of us; arise from your current position and go proclaim to a world that has been labeled as the enemy the works and words of Christ.
- This reflect Christ’s “great commission”
- Jonah responds with, “Not thy will but mine be done.”
- He is not a servant as he does his own will.
- Tried to “flee from the presence” of the Lord
- Whenever we disobey, we move away from the presence of the LORD.
- This  speaks more of our guilty heart. We want to put distance between us and God, knowing that being “close” to Him (i.e. “in his presence”) would mean the surrender of our will to do what He has asked us to do.

NET Bible has “go immediately” an so Jonah did, but he went immediately in the opposite direction.

> 1:3 Jonah got up to flee to Tarshish from the Lord’s presence. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. He paid the fare and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish from the Lord’s presence.

- Jonah paid for the fare. Even our earthly possession are misused and lost when we are in “escape” mode

> 1:4 But the Lord threw a great wind onto the sea, and such a great storm arose on the sea that the ship threatened to break apart.

- See how our sin is wide ranging?
- We NEVER sin in private. Others are ALWAYS affected
- Our sin causes us to head in the wrong direction
- Our sin can be the demise of others, as with Jonah and the sailors
- Because of Jonah’s sin and failure to turn in repentance, others suffered loss (cast the wares of the ship into the sea)
- the worlds subtle rebuke, “call out to YOUR God…” The very God he was running from, the sailors wanted Jonah to implore and ask for help

- Call upon, cry out, invoke
- To many, prayer is a method to “conjure” up some response. “If I say such-n-such then this-or-that will happen”

> 1:7 “Come on!” the sailors said to each other. “Let’s cast lots. Then we’ll know who is to blame for this trouble we’re in.” So they cast lots, and the lot singled out Jonah. 

- Your sin will find you out
- Your sin affects others
- Sin is not a “victim-less” crime. Even “secret” sins affect others around you.

- Disobedience or “running from God” always leads down.
  - Down to Joppa
  - Down into the “belly” of the ship
  - Down into the belly of the fish
  - Down to the depths of the sea
- The sailors wanted to know who is to blame, why is that?
- Why is it important to us that we know who is to blame for the calamities we are facing?
- Why not go straight to Him who controls all things, regardless of who is to blame?

> 1:11 So they said to him, “What should we do to you so that the sea will calm down for us?” For the sea was getting worse and worse.

- After hearing the truth, the sailor’s response was, “what must we do to be saved?”

> 1:12 He answered them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea so that it will calm down for you, for I know that I’m to blame for this great storm that is against you.”

- Jonah offers himself as a sacrifice to calm the storm, to “rescue” the passengers on the ship
- Jonah humbles himself in repentance, admitting publicly his fault.

> 1:13  Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they couldn’t because the sea was raging against them more and more.

- At first the sailors did not want this seemingly ghastly, albeit easy, solution
- They tried by their own efforts to move towards safety
- Jonah gave up his life for the sake of others.
- He counted his life as dung so that others might live
- I wonder how many would turn to the Lord and give him praise if we would give up our lives for Him?
- This is a hard thing to do, give up one’s life for others
- Why didn’t Jonah just jump overboard?
- Why did he have others throw him overboard?

## CHAPTER TWO

- In the belly 3 days and 3 nights
- first thing Jonah did was to pray to the LORD
- Interesting how our circumstances can dictate the frequency and urgency of our prayers
  -  What did he pray?
  -  There seems to be a spirit of repentance
  -  he does not blame God, but accepts what is happening as the correcting hand of God
  -  There also seems to be a sense of acceptance that “this is the end”
- Prophetic type of Christ
  -  heart of the earth (Matt 12:40; 16:4; 1Peter 3:19)
- He prayed to HIS God
- I cried to MY God
- Note how Jonah’s “rebirth” came after passing through water.
- He was immersed in water (baptism) then delivered from death to live in order to proclaim the words of God
- Jonah is a type of Christ in that after 3 days and nights he comes forth from the heart of the earth, the belly of Hell, alive to preach to the Gentiles

> 2:9 but as for me, I will sacrifice to you with a voice of thanksgiving. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation belongs to the Lord.

- It seems as though Jonah vowed something after he was “swallowed” up

## CHAPTER THREE

- Message comes a second time, meaning, the message has not changed
- Jonah comes “out of the grave” and is sent to preach to the Gentiles
- message == At the end of 40 days, the city WILL BE overthrown
- Septuagint has “at the end of 3 days”
- Notice faith with works
- They didn’t just believe, having “faith alone,” they had “works” that attended their faith.
- They didn’t “do works” to elicit or earn God’s favor.
- Works are part of repentance
- If they “believed” God but did not attempt to change their wicked ways, then their faith would be vain and dead
- Note the reaction to the message started among the people. The reaction was not forced on the people by the king
- fasted – total fast
- See how there was no message of deliverance? The message was only coming destruction
- “Who knows if God might change his mind?”
- God saw their ACTIONS and relented

## CHAPTER FOUR

- Grieved with great grief and confused
- “… I had the foresight to flee to Tarshish”
- I knew you ARE
  -  merciful and compassionate
  -  long-suffering and very merciful
  -  one who repents at calamities
- Take my life, better to be dead. Sounds like Elijah
- Jonah went out to see what would happen to the city. Was he still holding out hope that it might be destroyed?
- Did he think that God saw how upset Jonah was and would change His mind and destroyed Ninivah? Just to make Jonah happy?
- Why was Jonah happy for the gourd, then sad when it was destroyed? Because it directly affected him. It made him comfortable, shading him from the sun. When it was gone, he was miserable. 
- Did God use this as an object lesson to show Jonah it was not “all about him?”
