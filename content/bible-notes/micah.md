> Woe to those who dream up wickedness and prepare evil plans on their beds!
> At morning light they accomplish it because the power is in their hands.
> 
> They covet fields and seize them; they also take houses. They deprive a man of his home,
a person of his inheritance. (CSB)

Seems like a classic example of man's will and God's "sovereignty."  The wicked man plans evil and carries out his plan. His choice. Thus he inflicts on himself a deadly wound. That self-inflicted wound is left untreated and thus becomes incurable (Micah 1:9).

Note the evil plan. He oppresses the poor and the weak and takes their home and inheritance. If there’s one thing that stirs the ire of God, it is taking advantage of and oppressing the poor, the widow and the fatherless. Is this why verse 3 starts off with “Therefore?”

2:4 – 6
What goes around, comes around. Time wounds all heels!

> 2:9 You wrongly evict widows among my people from their cherished homes. You defraud their children of their prized inheritance (NET)

Here again we have God looking out for the widow and the weak.

> Get up and leave, for this is not your place of rest because defilement brings destruction— a grievous destruction!

Again, we see the consequences of sin, of going against the All Mighty. You defile yourself and the land. That defilement brings destruction. Destruction as an incurable disease. Sin is that self-inflicted defilement.

> 2:11 If a man comes and utters empty lies—
> “I will preach to you about wine and beer”—
> he would be just the preacher for this people!

Wow. Does that not describe 95% of politicians and 100% of prosperity gospel preachers?

2:12 - 13
A most comforting passage. Christ the Good Shepherd will gather His people and lead them in and out of that great City, the City of our God.
