# Chapter 1

1:1 This is a vision regarding Samaria and Jerusalem, not the United States.

1:2 God calls the entire earth as a witness to his just judgment.

1:5 All this is happening because of the rebellion of his people

Jacob == Samaria, the rebellion of Jacob
Judah == Jerusalem, the high place of Judah

1:8 Micah’s response to Samaria’s judgment
- lament and wailing
- barefoot and naked
- howling and mourning


What is my response to someone, some group or nation who falls under judgment?

Note the sin of Samaria is likened to a gangrenous wound. It is infecting Jerusalem.

Our sin not only destroys us, but it affects and infects others. This goes beyond the obvious external sins. This peeks into the trenches of the heart. There is bitterness and envy, choking out our life and like an unholy root it defiles others.

Who or what is Mareshah?

See how the children are taken? Taken into exile. Taken to a place foreign to the ways of God. These are the ones who will teach and indoctrinate those children who are exiled. Their (our) children will become their servants and slaves.


# Chapter 2

> Woe to those who dream up wickedness and prepare evil plans on their beds!
> At morning light they accomplish it because the power is in their hands.
> 
> They covet fields and seize them; they also take houses. They deprive a man of his home,
a person of his inheritance. (CSB)

Seems like a classic example of man's will and God's "sovereignty."  The wicked man plans evil and carries out his plan. His choice. Thus he inflicts on himself a deadly wound. That self-inflicted wound is left untreated and thus becomes incurable (Micah 1:9).

Note the evil plan. He oppresses the poor and the weak and takes their home and inheritance. If there’s one thing that stirs the ire of God, it is taking advantage of and oppressing the poor, the widow and the fatherless. Is this why verse 3 starts off with “Therefore?”

2:4 – 6
What goes around, comes around. Time wounds all heels!

2:7 The word of the Lord brings good to those who walk uprightly. For those who insist on their own way, the word of the Lord is restrictive.


> 2:9 You wrongly evict widows among my people from their cherished homes. You defraud their children of their prized inheritance (NET)

Here again we have God looking out for the widow and the weak.

> Get up and leave, for this is not your place of rest because defilement brings destruction— a grievous destruction!

Again, we see the consequences of sin, of going against the All Mighty. You defile yourself and the land. That defilement brings destruction. Destruction as an incurable disease. Sin is that self-inflicted defilement.

> 2:11 If a man comes and utters empty lies—
> “I will preach to you about wine and beer”—
> he would be just the preacher for this people!

Wow. Does that not describe 95% of politicians and 100% of prosperity gospel preachers?

Preach about wine and beer is more than just alcohol; the people love a preacher who will not preach anything of self-control and self-denial.

2:12 - 13
A most comforting passage. Christ the Good Shepherd will gather His people and lead them in and out of that great City, the City of our God.


# Chapter 3

3:4 God “block his ears” at the cry of the unrepentant

3:5 The unjust rich (has food) waging an unjust war against the poor (has no food)

They have darkness and no spiritual light or guidance

The false seers and prophets have no answer. This is contrasted with Micah, a prophet of the Lord who is filled with the power of the Spirit of the LORD, is filled with justice and courage to proclaim the truth.

3:11 A fitting discussion of our modern world.

# Chapter 4

This chapter is hard. It is difficult because much of it is still tainted and stained with my 40 years of dispensationalism. 

We definitely see the Church
- the ways of the Lord are made known
- the path to walk is taught
- brings peace and unity
- security because they trust in the Lord

Gathers the lame and those **I** injured.
Gathers for what?
To make them **My** people

Prophecy of Babylonian captivity and eventual deliverance

4:11 Many enemies assemble against the Church

4:13 Reminiscent of the deliverance from Egypt, whom they plundered.

Last days
- Lord’s house will be established at the to of a mountain
- People will stream to it
- They will be taught His ways
- Disputes will be settled
- swords beaten to plows, spears to knives
- No more war
- Safety

On that day
- the lame assembled
- the scattered, gathered
- These are they whom I injured
  - LXX has “those whom I have rejected”

Summary:
- Israel scattered, gathered, sent to Babylon, rescued, attacked, defended, victorious
- All apply, allegorically, to the Church

# Chapter 5

Coming soon

# Chapter 6

> What can we bring to the Lord? Should we bring him burnt offerings?
>
> Should we bow before God Most High with offerings of yearling calves?
>
> Should we offer him thousands of rams and ten thousand rivers of olive oil?
>
> Should we sacrifice our firstborn children to pay for our sins?
>
> No, O people, the Lord has told you what is good, and this is what he requires of you: to **do what is right**, to **love mercy**,


Verse 8, while quoted for various and sundry reasons, is the answer to the questions posed in verses 6 and 7.

What can you bring to the Lord? A life totally dedicated to Him and His will. A living sacrifice.


> Therefore, brothers and sisters, in view of the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your true worship.
>
>2 Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God. (Romans 12:1,2 CSB)
