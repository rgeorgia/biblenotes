## Why Read the Bible?

[St. John Chrysostom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostom) gave many reasons for the believer to read the Bible, here are eight of them[^1].

1. The Bible leads us to salvation
2. Scripture sanctifies us.
3. Scripture protects us from evils.
4. The Scripture is like a medicine chest with remedies for all troubles.
5. Knowledge of the Scriptures allows us to bear difficulties.
6. The Lord speaks to us through the Scriptures.
7. We learn how to be a Christian be reading the Scriptures.
8. We are exposed to immoral ideas and images which influence us every day. To counteract these influences we should read the Bible.

I will add...

9. The Bible was given to us by God so that we might become more like Christ.
> 12 For now we see only a reflection[a] as in a mirror, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, as I am fully known. 1 Corinthians 13:12 (CSB)
10. The Bible guides us along that narrow way.
> Your word is a lamp for my feet and a light on my path. Psalms 119:105 [118:105]

### Ruminate, meditate and collaborate

Above are 10 good reasons for reading the Bible. Pick one or more and be ready to present Scriptural backing along with thoughts that will both enlighten and encourage our group.

For example, how does the Scriptures protect us from evil? Or does it? Is number 3 valid or mere clicheanity?
