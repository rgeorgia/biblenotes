## The Triumph of Grace

## Reflection and Discussion

**1a**. Refute = since more sinning results in more grace we should sin more.

Since we are raised with Christ, we should walk in the newness of life. Our old self is crucified and we are no longer enslaved by sin. **Do not** let sin reign in your mortal bodies.

**1b**. What is the relationship between Romans 6:1-11 and 6:12-14

Verse 12 - Therefore... Because of what is revealed in 1 to 11, the believer should not choose sin over righteousness. We should not LET sin have dominion.

This is how we respond to the truth of 1 to 11. And yet the "doing" produces a perpetual cycle of faith and obedience. This is a synergistic relationship, in that the believer and God work together, in concert.

**1c**. If Paul tells the believer to pursue sacrificial obedience, why does he say we are not under the law?

We are _sacrificing_ or denying self to mortify the flesh in order to serve Christ. Not only that we deny ourselves to become more like Christ in word, deed, thought and attitude.

**1d**. According to 6:15-23, can you not be a slave to something?

No. We are either slaves to sin or slaves to Christ and righteousness.

**2a**. What is the basic point of 7:1-6?

This continues the theme that we can over come sin because we are not under or bound to the law. We were bound to the law, but then we died, and raising with Christ we are no longer bound. We are free to be with and serve Christ.

**2c**. If the law is so "negative", why does Paul say it's good?

Because it is holy and good. It reveals and exposes our sin.


## Willing Submission

- "So you must **consider** yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus."
- Though being dead to sin is a fact, we must **consider** or **recon** it to be so.
- We must acknowledge it is true, Why? Because there are times when it _feels_ like sin still has dominion.
- There are times when temptation, i.e. **presenting** your members to sinful passions seems to strong to resist.
- Do not let sin **reign** to **obey** its desires
- No longer **present** your members to sin but **present** yourselves to God
- If you **present** yourselves... as **obedient** slaves
- As you once **presented** your members ... to impurity, now **present** yourselves to God

> "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord"

Here is the conclusion and summary = obedience to sin results in death, obedience to righteousness in Christ, results in eternal life.

### Question / Thought

If we, who died being free from the law and joined to Christ, present ourselves to another man (i.e. the passions of sin), is that not also adultery?

## Romans 7

- Paul asserts that the Law is characteristic of this age only, with no eternal relevance.
- Passions = the inner appetites and compulsions that afflict the human soul
- We were fruitful for death
- How did it deceive him?
  - The appetite promised him happiness if he would indulge, but when he sinned and indulged, he found it brought unhappiness and death (Fr. Lawrence)

## Law and Faith

The law in concerned with what man does. The gospel is directed to what God does. Faith is concerned not with the Law, but with the incarnation of God's Son and his victorious resurrection.

These are the things that God does. Faith is not about what we can do for God, but what God has done and will do for us. In the incarnation and resurrection of Christ, God has reconciled the heights and the depths. Man is required to believe and to confess what God has done in Christ.

In (the) confession of faith, we observer the **primacy** of the **resurrection**, by which Christ put death to death. Putting our trust there, we will be saved. (Note the future tense for salvation) This salvation will be complete when our bodies are rasied from the dead at Christ's return (Romans 6:5)

"Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon all in the tombs bestowing life." (Apolytikon of Pascha)

## Observations from the Workbook

"Failure to fully measure up to God's standard." pg 47

- This seems to make Christianity a life of trying to measure up. Our life revolves around conforming to being like Christ, bearing his image, not living for some unreachable standard.

"The professed believer who claims that grace give him license to sin with abandon is not a believer at all." pg 47

- I am not sure we are in a position to judge who is saved and who is not. As pertaining to the context of this accusation, perhaps the individual was truly born again, then fell under the spell and influence of false teaching.

## General Raw and Random Notes

- grace saves us from sin and "saves" us to obedience
- Power of the union with Christ, the importance of the law in sanctification
- 6:3,4 ==> Baptism. Is this water baptism or some _spiritual_ baptism?
- united in death, united in resurrection
- 6:7 ==> For whoever is dead to sin is **freed** from sin. What does he mean _free_?
- 6:8 ==> cf Col 3:1-5
> 1 So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 
>
> 2 Set your minds on the things that are above, not on the things that are on earth, 
>
> 3 for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 
>
> 4 When Christ who is your[a] life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory.
>
> 5 Put to death, therefore, whatever in you is earthly = sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry). (NRSVue)

- 6:11 ==> Consider yourself dead to sin and **alive** to Christ
- Dominion
- 6:15 => Should we sin? This was answer in vss 12-14
- 6:16 => QUESTION = this death and life, is it physical, spiritual or both?
- From the study book = pursue sacrificial obedience, why is he saying we are not under the law?
- The law does not demand we make sacrifice, the law is to show us what sin is, how sinful we are and to bring us to Christ. 
  - "Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring[h] would come to whom the promise had been made, and it was ordained through angels by a mediator." Gal 3:19
- Paul argues that God's righteousness comes through faith, not by the law
- The role of the law was not to eliminate sin, but to "increase" it (?)
- **THOUGHT** = rejection of the law, for the Jew, would lead to moral chaos and anarchy. (Fr. Lawrence, The Epistle to the Romans, A Gospel for all)
- Paul "mono logs" with Judaizers, addressing their objections.
- Even though the Christian does not make the law central to their life yet they still experience freedom from sin.
- Through union with Christ and being led by the Holy Spirit, we can know the true righteousness of God.
- **Recon** yourself dead to sin
- Baptism shows we are "planted" in Christ
- Christ put sin to death by the cross
- Sin is pictured as a king, demanding loyal service and submission. (Can't remember where I read this)
- When we sin, we side with demons
- CHAPTER 7
- The law is **external**, grace is **internal**
- Not the **law** but **sin** lies within our members
- The Law does not eliminate sin, it reveals what it is and teaches us to hate sin.
- By "the flesh," Paul means the life of our senses, as it has degraded into a state of rebellion against God.
- Definition of the flesh = "living in the flesh, our sinful passions" Romans 7:5
