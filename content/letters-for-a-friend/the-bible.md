We are glad you are enjoying your new Bible. The Bible really is very important. The Bible is more than just words on a page, more than just stories, it is alive.

You said that when you read things, you forget what you just read. That’s okay. Just keep reading your new Bible. Why? Because, as the verse says, the word of God is alive. They affect you. Even if you can’t remember what you recently read

Reading the Bible is like planting seeds. When you plant some corn, if you never water, or weed or fertilize it, that seed will not grow. But if you take time to water that seed, and weed the garden and properly apply fertilizer, the seed will grow. You may not see any thing sprouting the next day, or even the next week. But that seed is alive. With proper care, it will grow. Reading the Bible is the same way. If you read regularly, you may think nothing is happening, but deep inside your heart it’s starting to grow.

So don’t give up. Keep reading. If you have questions or don’t understand something, write it down. We would be more that happy to answer them. If we don’t know the answer right away, we will definitely find it.

>“For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires.”
Hebrews chapter 4, verse 12

>“In the beginning the Word already existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God."
John 1:1
