We thought this information from the Bible would be helpful and wanted to share it with you.

Sin is like being having a deadly disease. A disease like AIDS. If two people have AIDS, they will both die if not treated. A person who recently contracted AIDS cannot say that they are better off than the person who is in the final stage of AIDS. They both have the AIDS and they both will die because of it. Both people are in need of healing.

We are all born sinners. Everyone has been infected with this deadly “disease” called sin. And the bible says that death is the result of sin. All those infected with sin will die. Someone who sins just a little can’t point to someone who sins a lot and say, I am better than that _big_ sinner. Sin is not confined to what we do or don’t do. Our actions are the result of how far advanced this disease has progressed. We cannot heal ourselves, no matter what we do or how hard we try. We all need a physician that can heal us. That physician is Jesus.

|The book of Isaiah|In Romans we find|
|:-----------------|:-----------------|
|“But he was pierced for our rebellion, crushed for our sins. He was beaten so we could be whole. He was whipped so we could be healed.”|“For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God’s glorious standard.”|

This is why Jesus came to earth as a man. He became human having the same body we all have. He lived as a human, yet never contracted the sin disease. He allowed himself to suffer the same consequence… death. Now the good news. Jesus conquered death by raising up from the dead three days after he died. The blood that he willing shed on the cross, and the power he displayed when he rose from the grave, provided a way for us to be healed. He is the only physician that holds the remedy for sin and death. That “remedy is free! It is given to anyone who comes by faith to Him. Of course, those who come to Jesus, the physician, must realize that they are infected and will die. (God tells us that those who die without coming to Jesus for the remedy will live eternally apart from God. This is a place the bible calls outer darkness.)

When we read through the Gospels, (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) we notice all those who were sick and came to Jesus, were healed. Often Jesus would say, “Your faith has saved you.” That is, they believed that only Jesus could heal them. Often people did whatever it took to get to Jesus in order to be healed. In the Bible, there is a story of people tearing up a roof to get to Jesus. Others pushed through crowds, or climbed trees; all to get to Jesus for healing.

It is the same way today. When we realize that this disease (sin) is killing us, we will do whatever it takes to come to Jesus and ask for healing. Ironically, we do not have to DO anything, we simply ask him by faith, to be healed. The bible says that Jesus literally washes away our sin, freely, making us clean. God tells us plainly, “But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from everything we've done wrong.”

The people who Jesus healed were very thankful. They wanted to follow him, no matter where he went. They did not want to return to those places where they might be infected again, rather they thankfully followed Jesus. Once we have asked Jesus to heal us from our sin, we begin a new life. A new start! Jesus encourages us to follow him. He warns us not to return to our old way of living, much like a counselor would warn a recovering alcoholic to stay away from bars.

You are a dear friend to us and we are happy to be in touch again.
