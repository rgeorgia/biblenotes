## Explain this to me

There’s a story in the Book of Acts where a highly educated man was reading the book of Isaiah as he rode in his chariot. A Christian named Phillip saw him and ran along side the chariot. He asked the man if he understood what he was reading. The man answered, “how can I unless someone explains it to me.” It is great to read your Bible, but sometimes it helps if someone can explain a few things.

## The First Step

>“The first step of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is to admit that you are powerless over alcohol and that your life has become unmanageable. This step is crucial as it marks the beginning of the recovery process.”

No alcoholic can achieve sobriety until they first admit that they have a problem and that alcohol is literally killing them.
No sinner can be pleasing to God until they take the first step, which is admitting that they are powerless to overcome sin and be pleasing to God.

## So what do I need to do?

"Okay, I see I am a sinner. I admit it. I see how sin has ruined my marriage and my life. Now what? I’m doing the best I can. I stopped drinking, smoking, you name it. Does that make me pleasing to God?"

The Bible plainly tells in the book of Titus, chapter 3 verses 4 and 5;

>God our Savior revealed his kindness and love, 
>he saved us, **not** because of the righteous things **we have done**, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit

Remember, we are all infected with sin. There is no one that has not sinned. Recall also, because of sin we all will die. As we just saw, no sinner can be pleasing to God. If we die, still _contaminated_ with sin, we will spend eternity in a place God calls outer darkness (which is Hell).

You might be thinking, "Wait a minute! Let me get this straight. I've admitted that I am a sinner. And the Bible says there’s nothing I can to do to get rid of my sin, no matter how good I try to be. And because of that I will spend forever in a place of outer darkness? That doesn't seem fair."

## Good News, Hope is on the way.

Our human nature is weak and will always drift towards sin. However, Jesus Christ came to earth as a man, yet he remained God. He was 100% man and 100% God. You may ask, "How is that possible?" It is a mystery. No one can really comprehend that. It is one of those things we just need to accept by faith.

> And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, 1Timothy 3:16

This is important. As a man, Christ Jesus never sinned. Not once. Ever. Yet, he willingly died for us. Remember, sin brings death. In order to defeat sin and death, Jesus willingly died in our place. As a man, he experienced every temptation we've experienced. Yet, he never gave in. As a man he felt abandoned by God while hanging on a cross. Just as we would feel if we died in our sins. In fact, the Bible says Jesus took our sins upon him. In one place the Bible is very clear about that, telling us that he became sin.

The Bible says, the sting of sin is death. In other words, defeat death you remove the grip of sin. Jesus did just that. After a little more than three hours Jesus died. The Bible says Jesus actually went into the place of the dead. The place of the dead is called the “lower parts of the earth.” It’s said that Death tried to hold him, but could not. Jesus broke free of death and rose from the grave… alive!

Let’s circle back to “So what do I need to do?” You need to do the same thing every person a live needs to do. Approach Christ by faith, knowing and admitting to him that you are powerless to change. Just like the alcoholic, admit to Christ Jesus that you can’t change and you need his help. He promises that he will help you by giving you a “new heart.” Actually, Jesus says that his Holy Spirit will take up residence in us, guiding us to be more like Christ. 

We hope this letter finds you well. Keep reading the Gospels.
